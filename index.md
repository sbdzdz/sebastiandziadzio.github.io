## Hi, I'm Sebastian

I'm an ELLIS/IMPRS-IS PhD Student at the University of TÃ¼bingen, supervised by Matthias Bethge. My main research interest is continual learning and evaluation at scale.

Prior to returning to academia, I conducted research in industry, working as a scientist at the [Microsoft Mixed Reality & AI Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/mixed-reality-ai-lab-cambridge/), and as an AI resident at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

Before getting into ML research, I spent a few years in industry working as a software engineer.
