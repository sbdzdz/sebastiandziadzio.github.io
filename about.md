# I write code to make sense of data

My name is Sebastian Dziadzio. I'm a software developer with a passion for natural language processing, machine learning, tech buzzwords, and Oxford commas. I love Python, have a love-hate relationship with R, and sometimes flirt with C++. When not coding, I'm usually fencing, reading, or playing Ultimate.

Currently I live in Munich, working at [Cliqz](http://cliqz.com) on making the Internet more private.

Feel free to [send me an e-mail](mailto:sebastian.dziadzio@gmail.com), [have a laugh at my code](https://github.com/sebastiandziadzio), or just [connect](https://linkedin.com/in/sebastiandziadzio). You may also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebadzia) for news on machine learning, programming, and technology.
