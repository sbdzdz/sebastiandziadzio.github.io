# Hi! I'm Sebastian.

I'm a software developer with a passion for computer vision, machine learning, and Oxford commas. When not coding, I'm usually fencing, reading, or playing Ultimate.

I'm currently a scientist at the Microsoft Mixed Reality & AI Lab in Cambridge. Before that, I was an AI resident at Microsoft Research.

You may also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebadzia) for news on machine learning, programming, and technology.
